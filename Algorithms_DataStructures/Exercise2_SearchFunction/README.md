# Exercise 2: E-commerce Search Function

## Objective
Implement linear and binary search for product lookup.

## Product Class
Each product has:
- productId
- productName
- category

## Search Methods
- **Linear Search**: O(n) — check each product
- **Binary Search**: O(log n) — search sorted product list

## Output Example
Linear Search found at index: 0
Binary Search found at index: 0


## Analysis
- Binary search is faster but requires sorted input.
- Linear search works on unsorted data.

## Conclusion
Use binary search for large, sorted product lists. Linear works for small/unsorted cases.
