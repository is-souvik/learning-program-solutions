# Exercise 1: Singleton Pattern

## Objective
Ensure only one instance of a logging utility is used throughout the application lifecycle.

## Key Concepts
- Private static instance
- Private constructor
- Public static method to access the instance

## Output Example
Logger Initialized
LOG: This is the first log.
LOG: This is the second log.
Only one instance exists. Singleton verified.


## Why Singleton?
To maintain consistent logging and prevent the creation of multiple logger objects.
